<!-- Note:

    The main structure below uses BillRefNumber as the main identifier
    of the bill to which the strip pertains.  I had been under the
    impression that BillRefNumber represents the internal LSB number
    assigned to a bill once it goes to first page proof.  This may
    be wrong, in which case some other element(s) should be used to
    indicate the bill to which the strip(s) pertain.

    The first optional CommentBlock is intended to for the drafter
    to say something about the entire strip file.  Thereafter, the
    CommentBlock child of each Strip element is intended to be used
    for specific instructions regarding the location of the strip
    by line number in the page proof, and whatever else the drafter
    wants to tell the technician handling the strip.

    The Strip element is, of course that which contains the content
    of the strip, i.e., replacement text to be copied and pasted
    into the page proof instance of the bill.
