<!-- Note:

    The main structure below uses BillNumber as the main identifier
    of the bill to which the message pertains.  I had been under the
    impression that BillNumber represents the internal LSB number
    assigned to a bill once it goes to first page proof.  This may
    be wrong, in which case some other element(s) should be used to
    indicate the bill to which the message(s) pertain.

    The first optional CommentBlock is intended to for the drafter
    to say something about the entire message file.  Thereafter, the
    CommentBlock child of each Message element is intended to be used
    for specific instructions regarding the location of the message
    by line number in the page proof, and whatever else the drafter
    wants to tell the technician handling the message.

    The Message element is, of course that which contains the content
    of the message, i.e., replacement text to be copied and pasted
    into the page proof instance of the bill.
